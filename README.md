1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
    *   Gradle 7.x or higher
    *   Maven 3.x (if working with Karaf distributions)
    *   An active internet connection to download dependencies

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Clone the repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Water-Framework/Distribution.git
    ```

3.  **Build the Project:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following Gradle command:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

    This command compiles the code, runs the tests, and packages the modules.

4.  **Module Usage:**

    *   **Distribution-karaf:**
        This module is used to create a Karaf feature file that defines how the Water Distribution project is deployed within a Karaf container. To use this module, include it as a dependency in your Karaf environment and activate the defined features. The `features.xml` file specifies the bundles and configurations required for different functionalities.

    *   **Distribution-osgi:**
        This module builds the core OSGi bundle for the Water Distribution framework. To use this module, deploy the generated OSGi JAR file into an OSGi container such as Karaf. The bundle provides the core services and components for water distribution management.

    *   **Distribution-quarkus:**
        This module provides a Quarkus-based implementation of the Water Distribution framework. To use this module, build the Quarkus application and deploy it to a Quarkus runtime environment. This provides a lightweight and fast runtime for water distribution services.

    *   **Distribution-spring:**
        This module offers a Spring-based implementation of the Water Distribution framework. To use this module, build the Spring application and deploy it to a Spring runtime environment. This provides a flexible and feature-rich environment for water distribution services.

5.  **Configuration:**

    *   **Environment Variables:**
        The project uses system properties for configuring repository credentials. Ensure that the `publishRepoUsername` and `publishRepoPassword` system properties are set when publishing the artifacts. These can be set as environment variables or passed directly to the Gradle command.

    *   **Karaf Configuration:**
        The Karaf environment is configured using feature files and configuration files. The `features.xml` file in the `Distribution-karaf` module defines the features and bundles to be installed. Custom system properties for Karaf can be set in the `custom.system.properties` file within the Karaf distribution modules.

6.  **Example: Using the OSGi Bundle in Karaf**

    To use the `Distribution-osgi` module within a Karaf container, follow these steps:

    1.  Build the `Distribution-osgi` module using Gradle:

        ```bash
        ./gradlew Distribution-osgi:build
        ```

    2.  Copy the generated OSGi JAR file (located in `Distribution-osgi/build/libs/`) to the `deploy` directory of your Karaf instance.

    3.  In your Karaf instance, verify that the bundle is installed and active using the `bundle:list` command.

    4.  Install the `water-core-features` feature:

        ```karaf
        feature:install water-core-features
        ```

        This will install all necessary dependencies and start the Water Distribution services.

## Functional Analysis

### 1. Main Responsibilities of the System

The primary responsibilities of the Water Distribution system include:

*   **Resource Management:** Managing water resources, including storage, distribution, and consumption.
*   **Service Provision:** Providing essential services for water distribution, such as data access, security, and validation.
*   **Runtime Environment Abstraction:** Abstracting the underlying runtime environment, allowing the system to run on Karaf, Spring, or Quarkus.

The system provides foundational services such as:

*   **Core API:** Defines the core interfaces and abstractions for water distribution management.
*   **Security:** Provides security features for protecting water resources and services.
*   **Registry:** Manages the registration and discovery of services and components.

### 2. Problems the System Solves

The Water Distribution system addresses the following key problems:

*   **Lack of Modularity:** Traditional water management systems often lack modularity, making it difficult to add or remove features. This system solves this by providing a modular architecture that allows for easy customization and extension.
*   **Runtime Environment Dependency:** Many systems are tied to a specific runtime environment, limiting their portability. This system provides implementations for Karaf, Spring, and Quarkus, allowing it to run on a variety of platforms.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating different components and services in a water management system can be complex and time-consuming. This system simplifies integration by providing a well-defined API and a modular architecture.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Traditional systems may not be able to scale to meet the demands of a growing population or increasing water consumption. This system is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle large amounts of data and traffic.

### 3. Interaction of Modules and Components

The modules and components within the Water Distribution system interact as follows:

*   **OSGi Bundle (Distribution-osgi):** Provides the core functionality and services. It interacts with the Karaf container for deployment and management.
*   **Karaf Feature (Distribution-karaf):** Defines how the OSGi bundle is deployed and managed within the Karaf container. It specifies the dependencies and configurations required for the system to run.
*   **Spring Application (Distribution-spring):** Provides an alternative implementation of the system using the Spring Framework. It interacts with the Spring container for dependency injection and other features.
*   **Quarkus Application (Distribution-quarkus):** Provides a lightweight and fast implementation of the system using Quarkus. It interacts with the Quarkus runtime environment for deployment and execution.

The system uses dependency injection to manage dependencies between components, ensuring loose coupling and testability. It also uses event handling to facilitate communication between different modules.

### 4. User-Facing vs. System-Facing Functionalities

The Water Distribution system provides both user-facing and system-facing functionalities:

*   **User-Facing Functionalities:**
    *   **REST Endpoints:** Provide access to water distribution services through a RESTful API.
    *   **Web UI (Karaf with Hawtio):** Allows users to monitor and manage water resources through a web-based interface.
*   **System-Facing Functionalities:**
    *   **Core API:** Defines the core interfaces and abstractions for water distribution management.
    *   **Security:** Provides security features for protecting water resources and services.
    *   **Registry:** Manages the registration and discovery of services and components.
    *   **Background Jobs:** Performs background tasks such as data synchronization and monitoring.

The user-facing functionalities allow users to interact with the system and manage water resources, while the system-facing functionalities provide the underlying infrastructure and services required for the system to operate.

## Architectural Patterns and Design Principles Applied

The Water Distribution project applies the following architectural patterns and design principles:

*   **Modularity:** The project is divided into separate modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system. This allows for flexibility and extensibility.
    *   *Example:* The `Distribution-karaf`, `Distribution-osgi`, `Distribution-spring`, and `Distribution-quarkus` modules each provide a different implementation of the system.
*   **Microservices:** The use of different runtime environments (Karaf, Spring, Quarkus) suggests a microservices approach, where different services can be deployed and scaled independently.
    *   *Example:* Each module can be deployed as a separate microservice, allowing for independent scaling and deployment.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The Spring and Quarkus modules leverage dependency injection to manage dependencies between components.
    *   *Example:* The Spring module uses the `@Autowired` annotation to inject dependencies into components.
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** The Karaf environment and the use of Apache CXF for RESTful web services indicate a service-oriented architecture.
    *   *Example:* The Karaf module exposes water distribution services as RESTful web services using Apache CXF.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Different modules are responsible for different aspects of the application, such as core functionality, deployment, and testing.
    *   *Example:* The `Distribution-osgi` module provides the core functionality, while the `Distribution-karaf` module handles deployment to a Karaf container.
*   **Convention over Configuration:** Gradle and Maven are used to define standard build processes and configurations, reducing the need for explicit configuration.
    *   *Example:* Gradle is used to define the build process for all modules, reducing the need for explicit configuration in each module.
*   **Testability:** The project includes unit tests and uses mocking frameworks to ensure testability.
    *   *Example:* JUnit Jupiter and Mockito are used to write unit tests for the core components.
*   **Interceptor Pattern:** Although not explicitly detailed, the presence of `Core-interceptors` suggests the use of interceptors for cross-cutting concerns. The `AtteoClassIndex` is used to locate these interceptors, indicating a dynamic and annotation-driven approach to applying them.
    *   *Example:* Interceptors could be used for logging, security checks, or transaction management.
